XISS (Keep it Simple Stupid) Game Panel

About:
----------
XISS Game panel is basically an enhanced open sourced clone-alike of Swift Panel.
It's aim is to take a simple approach with server managment over web interface.

Script is coded from foundations by Nate 'L0 utilizing some open source scripts 
in process. 

What does it offer?
----------
Script in current form (Alpha Pub Release) offers following:
- A simple FTP interface
- A simple auto refresing console interface (using screen utilites)
- Simple box installation
- Basic stats for box managing
- Simplifed server management
- Auto installing procedure of servers (currently manual pre-install of game is required)
- Simple ACL handling (User (customer), Reseller, Admin) with level based container.
- Simple user handling.
- Simplifed template handling (smarty templates).
- (arguably) simplifed OOP extendability.

What is currently planned for it? 
----------
- Cleaning of (duplicated) code and propper MVC separation of code.
- Fixing bunch of "unwanted features" (a.k.a. bugs).
- Support for other linux (box) distribution.
- Enhancing FTP & SSH (console) experience.
- Steam, TeamSpeak & Ventrilo support.
- Optimizing and enhancing reseller handling.

Developer notes:
----------
- XISS Game panel is running on custom (mini) framework I wrote time ago and which 
  I occasionally update. It's far from ideal and lacks some serious features before 
  it can even be labelled as framework..but hey, it works for me (most of the times).

- I've tried to stick to same standards of coding all over, but some code is old 
  or not made by me so standards in that case may vary. 
  
- I avoided duplicating code as much as I could but due limited framework approaches
  that sometimes simply wasn't possible. In future I'm planning to update it to more 
  correct and modern handling.
