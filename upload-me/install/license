	- Dispatcher:
		Was writen by me a while ago. I've used various sources for reference but wrote it by hand. 
		I do remember that core principle was deriven from specific example but sadly cannot remember the source.
		If anyone recognizes the code please contact me so I can credit the author and link to original source. 
	- Icons for templates:
		Some of icons were derived from icon pack under gpl license (original license got lost as it's been a while),
		but some of icons appear to be derived from CC alike licenses and as such in some cases they could be 
		incompatible with GPL license that they were distributed with. I didn't feel like hunting each icon used
		for it's license so if there's any problems or author wishes recognition or their work removed please 
		contact me at nate.afk@gmail.com.
		Css and Html was writen by me as such it's under GPLv3 license.
