Icons (Admin & Default):
================================================
/**
Icons were downloaded from following sources:

http://findicons.com
http://www.iconarchive.com

Icons have different licenses:  
- GPL (v2 or v3)
- CC (Various branches)

It's hard to maintain each individual file (point of origin) as sometimes
file is released on various different sources under different license/author so
instead of crediting individuals, I rather point out where I got them.

If any author feels (s)he should be credited or wants their work removed 
please drop me a note at my email: nate_afk@gmail.com and I'll gladly 
add it here/remove it from project.

Templates (Admin & Default)
================================================
/**
Templates that didn't derived from sources above were done by me (to greater extend),
as such you're free to do with them what you want. 
Script Source code is property licensed and has it's own license
but templates are released under WTFPL v2 License (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL).

Bottom line:
Do what you want..If you find templates usefull I wouldn't mind if you would 
drop a note under your credits, but if not, so be it. ;)
