Security:
------------------
- To enhance your security make sure all folders are owned by your web user (usually www-data).
- Make sure config.php is placed outside of webroot folder.
- Make sure all folders have permission set to 644 or alternatively to 755
  NOTE: Permissions are depended of how your server is configured..poorly configured
  servers will have issues with anything but 777 but in that case, you have a serious
  problem on your hand..which is beyond the scope of this instructions.
  

Extra:
------------------
Once you installed your script, you can overwrite general settings (inside config.php)
from your admin general settings.
